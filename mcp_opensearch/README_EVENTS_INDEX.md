# Events OpenSearch Index

This directory contains scripts to create and search an OpenSearch index for event data with hybrid search capabilities and spelling mistake tolerance.

## Overview

The events index is designed with:
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines standard text analysis with ngram-based fuzzy matching
- **Spelling Mistake Tolerance**: Automatic fuzzy matching handles common typos
- **Selective Field Indexing**: Only key fields are searchable to avoid information overlap
- **Year-wise Analysis**: Supports aggregations for temporal analysis
- **Country Filtering**: Fast filtering by country (Denmark/Dominica)

## Files

1. **`events_mapping.json`** - OpenSearch index mapping configuration
2. **`create_events_index.py`** - Script to create index and load documents
3. **`search_events.py`** - Example searches and analysis queries
4. **`docs2/`** - Directory containing 101 event JSON documents

## Field Configuration

### Searchable Fields (Indexed)
These fields are indexed for full-text search with fuzzy matching:
- **`event_title`** (boost: 3.0) - Highest priority in search
- **`event_theme`** (boost: 2.5) - High priority
- **`event_highlight`** (boost: 2.0) - Medium-high priority
- **`event_summary`** (boost: 1.5) - Medium priority
- **`event_object`** (boost: 1.2) - Lower priority

### Filterable Fields
- **`country`** (keyword) - For exact country filtering
- **`year`** (integer) - For range queries and aggregations
- **`event_count`** (integer) - For numerical analysis

### Stored-Only Fields (Not Indexed)
These fields are stored but not searchable to avoid overlap:
- `commentary_summary`
- `next_event_plan`
- `event_conclusion`
- `event_conclusion_overall`
- `next_event_suggestion`
- `rid`, `docid`, `url`

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- OpenSearch running on `localhost:9200`
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

### Step 1: Create Index and Load Data

```bash
python create_events_index.py
```

This script will:
1. Connect to OpenSearch
2. Delete existing `events` index if present
3. Create new index with mapping from `events_mapping.json`
4. Index all 101 JSON files from `docs2/`
5. Verify the index creation
6. Run demonstration searches

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Connected to OpenSearch
‚úÖ Created index: events
üìÅ Indexing 101 files from docs2/...
‚úÖ Successful: 101
üìä Total Documents: 101
```

### Step 2: Search the Index

```bash
python search_events.py
```

This demonstrates various search capabilities:
- Fuzzy search with spelling mistakes
- Hybrid search (standard + ngram)
- Country-based filtering
- Year range queries
- Year-wise aggregations
- Country-wise analysis
- Theme analysis

## Search Examples

### 1. Basic Fuzzy Search (Spelling Tolerance)

```python
from search_events import EventsSearcher

searcher = EventsSearcher()

# Handles spelling mistakes automatically
results = searcher.fuzzy_search("renewabel enrgy")  # "renewable energy"
searcher.print_search_results(results)
```

### 2. Hybrid Search (Better Fuzzy Matching)

```python
# Combines standard and ngram analyzers
results = searcher.hybrid_search("technology summit")
searcher.print_search_results(results)
```

### 3. Search by Country

```python
# Filter by specific country
results = searcher.search_by_country("conference", "Denmark")
searcher.print_search_results(results)
```

### 4. Search by Year Range

```python
# Filter by year range
results = searcher.search_by_year_range("summit", 2022, 2023)
searcher.print_search_results(results)
```

### 5. Year-wise Analysis

```python
# Get aggregated statistics by year
results = searcher.year_wise_analysis()

if results and 'aggregations' in results:
    for bucket in results['aggregations']['events_by_year']['buckets']:
        year = bucket['key']
        count = bucket['doc_count']
        avg_attendance = bucket['avg_attendance']['value']
        print(f"Year {year}: {count} events, avg attendance: {avg_attendance:.0f}")
```

### 6. Country-wise Analysis

```python
# Get aggregated statistics by country
results = searcher.country_wise_analysis()

# Or filter by specific year
results = searcher.country_wise_analysis(year=2023)
```

### 7. Direct HTTP Query

```python
import requests

query = {
    "query": {
        "multi_match": {
            "query": "climate change",
            "fields": ["event_title^3", "event_theme^2.5"],
            "fuzziness": "AUTO"
        }
    },
    "size": 5
}

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:9200/events/_search",
    json=query,
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
)

results = response.json()
for hit in results['hits']['hits']:
    print(hit['_source']['event_title'])
```

## Why Hybrid Search?

The index uses **hybrid search** combining:

1. **Standard Analyzer**
   - Good for exact word matches
   - Handles stopwords
   - Fast and efficient

2. **Ngram Analyzer**
   - Breaks text into overlapping 3-4 character chunks
   - Excellent for fuzzy matching
   - Handles partial word matches
   - More tolerant of spelling mistakes

Example: Query "technolgy" (misspelled)
- Standard analyzer with fuzziness: Finds "technology"
- Ngram analyzer: Matches "tech", "echn", "chno", etc.
- Combined: Higher relevance scores for true matches

## Why Selective Indexing?

The event documents have significant information overlap between fields:
- `event_summary` contains overview information
- `commentary_summary` repeats similar information from commentator perspective
- `event_conclusion` and `event_conclusion_overall` overlap significantly
- `next_event_plan` and `next_event_suggestion` have similar content

**Solution**: Only index the most distinctive fields (`event_title`, `event_theme`, `event_highlight`, `event_summary`, `event_object`) to:
- Avoid duplicate matches
- Improve search relevance
- Reduce index size
- Speed up searches

Overlapping fields are stored but not indexed, so they're returned in results but don't affect search scoring.

## Spelling Mistake Handling

The index handles spelling mistakes through:

1. **Fuzziness**: `"fuzziness": "AUTO"` in queries
   - 1-2 character words: no fuzziness
   - 3-5 character words: 1 character edit distance
   - 6+ character words: 2 character edit distance

2. **Ngram Matching**: Characters are split into chunks
   - "renewable" ‚Üí "ren", "ene", "new", "ewa", "wab", "abl", "ble"
   - "renewabel" (misspelled) ‚Üí "ren", "ene", "new", "ewa", "wab", "abe", "bel"
   - Significant overlap ensures matching

3. **Edge Ngram**: For autocomplete-style matching
   - "tech" matches "technology", "technical", "techno"

## Index Statistics

After running `create_events_index.py`:
- **Total Documents**: 101
- **Searchable Fields**: 5 text fields
- **Filterable Fields**: 3 (country, year, event_count)
- **Stored-Only Fields**: 8
- **Years Covered**: 2021, 2022, 2023
- **Countries**: Denmark (51 events), Dominica (50 events)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Error
```
‚ùå Cannot connect to OpenSearch
```
**Solution**: Ensure OpenSearch is running:
```bash
# Check if OpenSearch is running
curl http://localhost:9200

# Start OpenSearch if needed
# (varies by installation method)
```

### No Results Found
```
üìä Total matches: 0
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify index was created: `curl http://localhost:9200/events`
2. Check document count: `curl http://localhost:9200/events/_count`
3. Re-run `create_events_index.py`

### Import Error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```
**Solution**: Install requests library:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Query
```python
import requests

custom_query = {
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "must": [
                {
                    "multi_match": {
                        "query": "renewable energy",
                        "fields": ["event_title", "event_theme"],
                        "fuzziness": "AUTO"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "filter": [
                {"term": {"country": "Denmark"}},
                {"range": {"year": {"gte": 2022}}}
            ]
        }
    },
    "size": 10,
    "sort": [
        {"year": "desc"},
        {"_score": "desc"}
    ]
}

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:9200/events/_search",
    json=custom_query,
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
)

results = response.json()
```

### Year-over-Year Comparison
```python
query = {
    "size": 0,
    "aggs": {
        "years": {
            "date_histogram": {
                "field": "year",
                "calendar_interval": "year",
                "format": "yyyy"
            },
            "aggs": {
                "avg_attendance": {"avg": {"field": "event_count"}},
                "total_attendance": {"sum": {"field": "event_count"}}
            }
        }
    }
}
```
