# Multi-Task Agentic Search Implementation

## Overview

The agentic search system has been enhanced to support multi-task planning and execution. The agent now:

1. **Creates a plan** with multiple tasks (each task = a tool call)
2. **Executes each task** sequentially, gathering information
3. **Synthesizes information** from all tasks
4. **Responds to user** with comprehensive answer

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Data Models (`state_definition.py`)

#### New Structured Models:

- **`Task`**: Represents a single task in the execution plan
  - `task_number`: Sequential task number
  - `tool_name`: Tool to call
  - `tool_arguments`: Parameters for the tool
  - `description`: What this task accomplishes
  - `status`: pending, executing, completed, failed
  - `result`: Result from tool execution

- **`ExecutionPlan`**: Complete execution plan with multiple tasks
  - `tasks`: List of Task objects
  - `reasoning`: Why these tasks are needed
  - `plan_created_at`: Timestamp

- **`GatheredInformation`**: Structured information from all tasks
  - `task_results`: Results from each task
  - `summary`: Summary of gathered information
  - `sources_used`: Tools/sources used

- **`FinalResponse`**: Structured final response
  - `response_content`: HTML formatted response
  - `reasoning`: Synthesis reasoning
  - `information_used`: Reference to gathered information

### 2. Updated Prompts (`prompts.py`)

#### New Prompts:

- **`create_multi_task_planning_prompt`**: Guides the agent to create a plan with 2-3+ tasks
  - Emphasizes reusing tools with different parameters
  - Encourages comprehensive information gathering

- **`create_information_synthesis_prompt`**: Guides the agent to:
  - Analyze all task results
  - Cross-reference information from different sources
  - Generate comprehensive HTML response
  - Show connections between different information sources

### 3. New Node Implementation (`nodes.py`)

#### New Nodes:

1. **`create_execution_plan_node`**:
   - Creates multi-task execution plan
   - Validates each task has required fields
   - Shows plan details in thinking steps

2. **`execute_task_node`**:
   - Executes one task at a time
   - Updates task status (pending → executing → completed)
   - Stores result in task object
   - Moves to next task

3. **`gather_and_synthesize_node`**:
   - Gathers results from all completed tasks
   - Calls LLM to synthesize information
   - Creates FinalResponse with reasoning
   - Saves to conversation history

#### Updated Nodes:

- **`initialize_search_node`**: Updated to initialize new state fields
- **`discover_tools_node`**: Unchanged, works with existing structure

### 4. New Workflow (`graph_definition.py`)

#### Workflow Flow:

```
initialize_search_node
        ↓
discover_tools_node
        ↓
create_execution_plan_node
        ↓
execute_task_node ←──┐ (loops for each task)
        ↓             │
  [more tasks?] ──────┘
        ↓
gather_and_synthesize_node
        ↓
      END
```

#### Routing Logic:

- **After plan creation**: Start executing first task
- **After task execution**:
  - If more tasks → execute next task
  - If all tasks done → gather and synthesize
- **After synthesis**: Always end

### 5. Server Updates (`server.py`)

- Updated `relevant_node_names` to include new nodes
- Updated response extraction to handle `FinalResponse` structure
- Maintains backward compatibility with old field names

## Benefits

### 1. **Tool Reusability**
- Same tool can be called multiple times with different parameters
- Example: Search for "AI" and "machine learning" separately

### 2. **Multi-Tool Usage**
- Single query can use multiple different tools
- Example: Search + Fetch details + Analyze

### 3. **Information Synthesis**
- Agent analyzes ALL task results together
- Identifies patterns and connections
- Provides comprehensive answers

### 4. **Structured Data**
- All data uses Pydantic models
- Type safety and validation
- Clear data flow

### 5. **Transparency**
- Shows planned tasks before execution
- Tracks task completion status
- Explains synthesis reasoning

## Example Workflow

### User Query: "What are the latest AI developments?"

#### 1. Planning Phase:
```json
{
  "reasoning": "Need to gather comprehensive AI news from multiple angles",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_number": 1,
      "tool_name": "search_stories",
      "tool_arguments": {"query": "artificial intelligence latest", "size": 10},
      "description": "Search for general AI developments"
    },
    {
      "task_number": 2,
      "tool_name": "search_stories",
      "tool_arguments": {"query": "machine learning breakthroughs", "size": 10},
      "description": "Search for ML-specific news"
    },
    {
      "task_number": 3,
      "tool_name": "search_stories",
      "tool_arguments": {"query": "AI research papers", "size": 5},
      "description": "Find recent research papers"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Execution Phase:
- Task 1 executes → gathers AI news
- Task 2 executes → gathers ML news
- Task 3 executes → gathers research papers

#### 3. Synthesis Phase:
```json
{
  "reasoning": "Combined results show 3 main trends: LLM advances, computer vision improvements, and ethical AI frameworks",
  "response_content": "<div>...comprehensive HTML response...</div>"
}
```

## Configuration

### No Configuration Changes Required

The system maintains backward compatibility. Existing queries will work with the new system.

### Optional: Enable Specific Tools

```python
inputs = {
    "input": "query",
    "enabled_tools": ["search_stories", "fetch_details"]
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
cd agentic_search
python test_multi_task.py
```

Or start the server and test via HTTP:

```bash
python server.py
# Then open browser to http://localhost:8023
```

## Limitations

1. **Max Iterations**: Still uses iteration limit (default: 1) for safety
2. **Sequential Execution**: Tasks execute one at a time (not parallel)
3. **Tool Availability**: Requires tools to be available in MCP registry

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel Task Execution**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously
2. **Dynamic Planning**: Adjust plan based on intermediate results
3. **Task Dependencies**: Define which tasks depend on others
4. **Caching**: Cache tool results to avoid redundant calls
5. **Task Prioritization**: Execute high-priority tasks first

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes: None

The system is backward compatible. Old state fields are handled gracefully.

### Deprecations:

- `plan` field (old PlanStep structure) → Use `execution_plan` (new ExecutionPlan)
- `tool_execution_results` → Use `gathered_information.task_results`
- `final_response_content` → Use `final_response.response_content`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No tasks generated

**Solution**: Check that enabled_tools are available and LLM is generating valid JSON

### Issue: Tasks fail to execute

**Solution**: Verify MCP registry is running and tools are accessible

### Issue: Synthesis fails

**Solution**: Check that at least one task completed successfully

## Summary

The multi-task implementation transforms the agent from single-tool execution to comprehensive information gathering with:

- ✅ Multiple tasks per query
- ✅ Tool reusability with different parameters
- ✅ Multi-tool usage in single query
- ✅ Information synthesis across all results
- ✅ Structured data models
- ✅ Backward compatibility
