# Gateway URL Format Update

## Summary

Modified the Tools Gateway to accept **full endpoint URLs** instead of hardcoding the `/mcp` path. This allows the gateway to work with both traditional `/mcp` endpoints and FastMCP's `/sse` endpoints (or any custom endpoint paths).

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **`tools_gateway/services.py`**
   - `forward_request_streaming()` - Line 112: Changed `f"{server_url}/mcp"` to `server_url`
   - `_check_server_health()` - Line 296: Changed `f"{server_url}/mcp"` to `server_url`
   - `_fetch_tools_from_server()` - Line 397: Changed `f"{server_url}/mcp"` to `server_url`

2. **`tools_gateway/mcp_storage.py`**
   - `register_server_from_url()` - Line 160: Changed `f"{server_url}/mcp"` to `server_url`
   - `test_server_connection()` - Line 289: Changed `f"{endpoint}/mcp"` to `endpoint`

## URL Format

### Before (Old Format)
```
Server URL: http://localhost:8001
Gateway appended: /mcp
Final endpoint: http://localhost:8001/mcp
```

### After (New Format)
```
Server URL (with /mcp): http://localhost:8001/mcp
Gateway uses directly: http://localhost:8001/mcp

Server URL (with /sse): http://localhost:8002/sse
Gateway uses directly: http://localhost:8002/sse
```

## Examples

### Register servers with full URLs

**Traditional MCP Server:**
```
http://localhost:8001/mcp
```

**FastMCP Server with SSE:**
```
http://localhost:8002/sse
```

**Custom Endpoint:**
```
http://localhost:8003/api/mcp-endpoint
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Flexibility** - Supports any endpoint path (/mcp, /sse, custom paths)
2. ✅ **Simplicity** - No path manipulation logic needed
3. ✅ **Explicitness** - URL format is clear and unambiguous
4. ✅ **FastMCP Compatibility** - Works seamlessly with FastMCP's `/sse` endpoint

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Servers

If you have existing servers registered with just the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8001`), you need to update them to include the endpoint path:

**Old:** `http://localhost:8001`
**New:** `http://localhost:8001/mcp`

### For New Servers

When registering new servers via the UI or API, provide the complete endpoint URL:

- Traditional: `http://localhost:8001/mcp`
- FastMCP: `http://localhost:8002/sse`

## Testing

The gateway will now work with:

1. **Old MCP servers** - Use `http://host:port/mcp`
2. **FastMCP servers** - Use `http://host:port/sse` (or custom `sse_path`)
3. **Custom implementations** - Use any path you configure

## Notes

- The gateway's own `/mcp` endpoint remains unchanged
- This change is backward incompatible with servers registered using base URLs only
- Update existing server registrations to include the full endpoint path
