# AD Groups & Users UI Feature - Complete

## ✅ Feature Successfully Implemented!

The tools_gateway service now has a complete interface to view fetched AD groups and users, with local storage persistence for authorization management.

## Overview

Users can now:
1. Query AD groups from the Active Directory Configuration panel
2. View all fetched groups in a dedicated "Fetched AD Groups & Users" panel
3. Click on any group to expand and view its members
4. All data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage for authorization purposes
5. Refresh data from AD at any time
6. Clear local data when needed

## Feature Workflow

### Step 1: Configure AD Connection
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8021
2. Go to "Users & Roles" tab
3. Fill in AD Configuration:
   - Server: `ldap.forumsys.com`
   - Port: `389`
   - Bind DN: `cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com`
   - Password: `password`
   - Base DN: `dc=example,dc=com`
   - Group Filter: `(objectClass=*)`
   - Use SSL: `No`

### Step 2: Query Groups
1. Click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity
2. Click "Save Configuration" to store settings
3. Click "Query Groups" to fetch all groups

### Step 3: View Fetched Groups
1. Scroll down to "Fetched AD Groups & Users" panel
2. See all fetched groups displayed as cards
3. Each card shows:
   - Group icon
   - Group name
   - Distinguished Name (DN)
   - Member count badge

### Step 4: View Group Members
1. Click on any group card to expand it
2. Members are fetched from AD dynamically
3. Each member shows:
   - User icon
   - Display name
   - Email address
   - Username badge

### Step 5: Data Persistence
- All fetched data is automatically stored in localStorage
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Shows "Last fetched" timestamp
- Can refresh from AD at any time
- Can clear local data when needed

## Technical Details

### LocalStorage Structure
```javascript
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "Mathematicians",
      "dn": "ou=mathematicians,dc=example,dc=com",
      "member_count": 5,
      "members": [
        {
          "username": "euclid",
          "email": "euclid@ldap.forumsys.com",
          "display_name": "Euclid"
        },
        // ... more members
      ]
    },
    // ... more groups
  ],
  "users": [],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T10:20:00.000Z"
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Query Groups
```
POST /admin/ad/query-groups
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "server": "ldap.forumsys.com",
  "port": 389,
  "bind_dn": "cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com",
  "bind_password": "password",
  "base_dn": "dc=example,dc=com",
  "group_filter": "(objectClass=*)",
  "use_ssl": false
}

Response:
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "Mathematicians",
      "dn": "ou=mathematicians,dc=example,dc=com",
      "member_count": 5
    },
    ...

### Security Features

1. **First-time Setup Bypass**:
   - When no users exist in the system, allows unauthenticated AD testing
   - After first user is created, requires authentication

2. **Permission Checks**:
   - Requires `USER_MANAGE` permission for authenticated users
   - Audit logging for all AD operations

3. **Credential Storage**:
   - Passwords stored temporarily in memory during session
   - Not persisted to localStorage for security
   - Must be re-entered after page refresh

## UI Features

### Group Card Display
- Modern card-based layout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Click to expand/collapse
- Icon-based visual indicators
- Badge for member count

### Member List Display
- Clean, organized member list
- Avatar icons for each member
- Email and username clearly displayed
- Responsive layout

### Toolbar Actions
- **Refresh**: Re-fetch all groups from AD
- **Clear Data**: Remove all data from localStorage
- Shows last fetched timestamp

## Testing Results

All tests passing with forumsys.com test server:

```
✅ Query AD groups from forumsys test server
✅ Query group members from AD group
✅ Parse user attributes (username, email, display_name)
✅ First-time setup authentication bypass
✅ Local storage persistence
✅ UI data display and interaction
```

### Test Data (from forumsys.com)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Enhanced Authorization**:

   - Auto-sync user permissions

2. **User Management**:
   - Create/edit users from fetched AD data
   - Bulk operations (enable/disable users)
   - Role assignment from UI

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Search/filter groups and users
   - Nested group support
   - Group hierarchy visualization
   - Export to CSV/JSON

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Encrypted credential storage
   - Session-based credential caching
   - Audit trail for all operations
   - Rate limiting for AD queries
