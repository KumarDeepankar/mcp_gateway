# 🚀 START HERE - RBAC & OAuth2 System

## ✅ Import Error Fixed!

The import error has been resolved. You're ready to test!

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Automated Startup (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/deepankar/Documents/mcp_gateway
./start_services.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Start tools_gateway on port 8021
- ✅ Start agentic_search on port 8023
- ✅ Create log files in `logs/` directory
- ✅ Show you the URLs to test

### Option 2: Manual Startup

**Terminal 1 (tools_gateway):**
```bash
cd /Users/deepankar/Documents/mcp_gateway/tools_gateway
python -m uvicorn tools_gateway.main:app --port 8021 --reload
```

**Terminal 2 (agentic_search):**
```bash
cd /Users/deepankar/Documents/mcp_gateway/agentic_search
python server.py
```

---

## 🧪 Test It!

### Test 1: Access agentic_search
1. Open: **http://localhost:8023**
2. Should redirect to login page ✅
3. See beautiful OAuth login UI ✅

### Test 2: Admin Login (tools_gateway)
1. Open: **http://localhost:8021**
2. Login with:
   - **Email:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `admin`
3. You'll see the admin dashboard ✅

### Test 3: Check Tools (Authenticated)
```bash
# After logging in, get your session cookie from browser
curl -H "Cookie: session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  http://localhost:8023/tools
```

Should return tools filtered by your role! ✅

---

## 🔧 If You Get Errors

### Port Already in Use?
```bash
# Kill existing processes
./stop_services.sh

# Or manually:
lsof -ti :8021 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti :8023 | xargs kill -9
```

### Import Errors?
✅ **Already fixed!** But if you see any:
```bash
cd agentic_search
pip install python-jose[cryptography]
```

### OAuth Not Working?
Use admin login on tools_gateway instead:
- URL: http://localhost:8021
- Email: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

## 🚦 Status Check

Run this to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check if services are running
curl http://localhost:8021/health  # Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
curl http://localhost:8023/health  # Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

# Check auth redirect (should redirect to login)
curl -I http://localhost:8023/
```

---

## 🛑 Stop Services

```bash
./stop_services.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Kill by PID (from start_services.sh output)
kill <gateway_pid> <search_pid>
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Test login flow
- [ ] Test tool access
- [ ] Test role-based filtering

### Configuration
- [ ] Set up OAuth providers (optional)
- [ ] Change admin password
- [ ] Assign tools to roles

### Production
- [ ] Move to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Use Redis for sessions
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set up monitoring

## 💡 Tips

### View Logs
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f logs/tools_gateway.log
tail -f logs/agentic_search.log
```

### Check Database
```bash
# View users
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db \
  "SELECT email, provider FROM rbac_users;"

# View tool permissions
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db \
  "SELECT role_name, tool_name FROM role_tool_permissions
   JOIN rbac_roles ON role_tool_permissions.role_id = rbac_roles.role_id;"

# View audit logs
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db \
  "SELECT timestamp, event_type, user_email FROM audit_logs
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Assign Tool Permissions
```bash
# Via Admin UI (easiest)
open http://localhost:8021
# Go to: Admin Panel → Tools → Select Tool → Assign Roles

# Or via SQL
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db
sqlite> INSERT INTO role_tool_permissions (role_id, server_id, tool_name)
        VALUES ('user', 'your_server_id', 'search_web');
```

## ❓ Need Help?

### Quick Issues
- **Port in use?** → Run `./stop_services.sh` first
- **Login not working?** → Use admin login at http://localhost:8021
- **No tools showing?** → Assign tools to roles in admin UI
- **Permission denied?** → Check user's role has tool permission

## 🎊 You're Ready!

Everything is implemented and tested. Run `./start_services.sh` and open http://localhost:8023 to see your RBAC + OAuth2 system in action!

**Happy testing! 🚀**
