# Testing Guide - RBAC & OAuth2 Integration

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

All phases have been successfully implemented. This guide will help you test the end-to-end authentication and authorization system.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Environment Configuration
- Generated secure JWT secret
- Created `.env` files for both services
- Configured shared JWT_SECRET

### ✅ Phase 2: tools_gateway Auth Redirect Endpoints
- `/auth/login-redirect` - Initiates OAuth with redirect
- `/auth/callback-redirect` - Handles callback and redirects with JWT

### ✅ Phase 3: tools_gateway MCP Router Authorization
- JWT validation on all MCP requests
- Role-based tool filtering for `tools/list`
- Permission checking for `tools/call`
- Comprehensive audit logging

### ✅ Phase 4: agentic_search Auth Module
- `auth.py` - JWT validation and session management
- Session storage (in-memory, move to Redis for production)
- User context helpers

### ✅ Phase 5: agentic_search Auth Routes & UI
- `auth_routes.py` - Login/logout/callback endpoints
- Beautiful login page with OAuth buttons
- Session cookie management

### ✅ Phase 6: MCP Client JWT Integration
- Added JWT token parameter to MCP client
- `set_jwt_token()` method for runtime updates
- Authorization header on all MCP requests
- Error handling for 401/403 responses

### ✅ Phase 7: Server Auth Middleware
- Protected all endpoints with authentication
- Auto-redirect to login if not authenticated
- JWT token injection into MCP client

### ✅ Phase 8: Testing (Current)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Start tools_gateway (Port 8021)

```bash
cd /Users/deepankar/Documents/mcp_gateway/tools_gateway
python -m uvicorn tools_gateway.main:app --port 8021 --reload
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8021
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Step 2: Start agentic_search (Port 8023)

```bash
cd /Users/deepankar/Documents/mcp_gateway/agentic_search
python server.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Starting Agentic Search Service on 127.0.0.1:8023
Make sure Ollama is running with llama3.2:latest model
Make sure MCP Registry Discovery is running on port 8021
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8023
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Login Flow

**Steps:**
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:8023/`
2. Should redirect to: `http://localhost:8023/auth/login`
3. Click "Login with Google" (or other provider)
4. Should redirect to tools_gateway OAuth
5. **Note:** If OAuth not configured, you'll get an error. See OAuth Setup below.

**Alternative: Test with Admin Login (tools_gateway)**
1. Open: `http://localhost:8021/`
2. Login with:
   - Email: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
3. You'll get a JWT token

### Test 2: Anonymous Access (Should Fail)

```bash
# Try to access tools without auth
curl http://localhost:8023/tools

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
# {"detail":"Authentication required. Please log in."}
```

### Test 3: Authenticated Access

```bash
# First, login and get token from browser dev tools (Application > Cookies > session_id)
# Or use admin login to get JWT token

# Test with session cookie
curl -H "Cookie: session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  http://localhost:8023/tools

# Expected: List of tools user has access to
```

### Test 4: Tool Filtering by Role

**Setup:**
1. Login to tools_gateway admin: `http://localhost:8021/`
2. Go to Admin Panel → Tools
3. For tool "search_web": assign to role "user"
4. For tool "admin_tool": assign to role "admin" only

**Test as regular user:**
```bash
# Login as user with role="user"
curl http://localhost:8023/tools \
  -H "Cookie: session_id=USER_SESSION_ID"

# Expected: Only see "search_web", not "admin_tool"
```

**Test as admin:**
```bash
# Login as admin
curl http://localhost:8023/tools \
  -H "Cookie: session_id=ADMIN_SESSION_ID"

# Expected: See all tools including "admin_tool"
```

### Test 5: Tool Execution Authorization

```bash
# Try to execute unauthorized tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8023/search \
  -H "Cookie: session_id=USER_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test", "enabled_tools": ["admin_tool"]}'

# Expected: Permission denied or tool not found (filtered out)
```

### Test 6: Audit Logging

```bash
# Check audit logs in tools_gateway
sqlite3 /Users/deepankar/Documents/mcp_gateway/tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db

sqlite> SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected logs:**
- AUTH_LOGIN_SUCCESS
- AUTH_TOKEN_VERIFIED
- AUTHZ_PERMISSION_GRANTED
- AUTHZ_PERMISSION_DENIED (if tried unauthorized access)

## 🔧 OAuth Provider Setup

If you haven't configured OAuth providers yet:

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project or select existing
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8021/auth/callback-redirect`
6. Copy Client ID and Secret
7. Add to `tools_gateway/.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

### Configure in tools_gateway UI

1. Open: `http://localhost:8021/`
2. Login as admin
3. Go to Admin Panel → OAuth Providers
4. Click "Add Provider"
5. Fill in:
   - Provider ID: `google`
   - Provider Name: `Google`
   - Client ID: (paste from Google Console)
   - Client Secret: (paste from Google Console)
   - Use Google template (pre-filled URLs)
6. Click Save

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid JWT signature"

**Cause:** JWT_SECRET mismatch between services

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check both .env files
cat tools_gateway/.env | grep JWT_SECRET
cat agentic_search/.env | grep JWT_SECRET

# Must be exactly the same!
```

### Error: "Authentication required"

**Cause:** Not logged in or session expired

**Fix:**
1. Clear cookies
2. Go to `/auth/login`
3. Login again

### Error: "Permission denied" for tool

**Cause:** User role doesn't have permission for that tool

**Fix:**
1. Login to tools_gateway as admin
2. Go to Admin → Tools
3. Click on the tool
4. Add user's role to allowed roles

### Error: "OAuth provider not found"

**Cause:** OAuth provider not configured

**Fix:**
1. Follow OAuth Provider Setup above
2. Or use local admin login instead

### Error: Tools list is empty

**Cause:** No MCP servers registered or no tools assigned to user's role

**Fix:**
1. Register MCP servers in tools_gateway
2. Assign tools to user's role
3. Check: `http://localhost:8021/admin/tools`

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Active Sessions

```bash
# In agentic_search, sessions are in-memory
# Check server logs for session creation messages
```

### Check User Roles

```bash
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db

sqlite> SELECT u.email, u.provider, r.role_name
        FROM rbac_users u
        JOIN user_roles ur ON u.user_id = ur.user_id
        JOIN rbac_roles r ON ur.role_id = r.role_id;
```

### Check Tool Permissions

```bash
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db

sqlite> SELECT r.role_name, rtp.server_id, rtp.tool_name
        FROM role_tool_permissions rtp
        JOIN rbac_roles r ON rtp.role_id = r.role_id
        ORDER BY r.role_name, rtp.tool_name;
```

### View Audit Logs

```bash
sqlite3 tools_gateway/tools_gateway.db

# Recent authentication events
sqlite> SELECT timestamp, event_type, user_email, details
        FROM audit_logs
        WHERE event_type LIKE 'AUTH_%'
        ORDER BY timestamp DESC
        LIMIT 10;

# Authorization denials
sqlite> SELECT timestamp, user_email, resource_id as tool_name, details
        FROM audit_logs
        WHERE event_type = 'AUTHZ_PERMISSION_DENIED'
        ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your system is working correctly if:

1. ✅ Accessing `http://localhost:8023/` redirects to login page
2. ✅ After OAuth login, redirected back to chat interface
3. ✅ `/tools` endpoint returns filtered tools based on role
4. ✅ Unauthorized tools are hidden from tools list
5. ✅ Tool execution is blocked for unauthorized tools (403)
6. ✅ All auth events logged in audit_logs table
7. ✅ Session persists across page refreshes
8. ✅ Logout clears session and redirects to login

---

## 🎯 Next Steps
